# Town Builders App

Place blocks to build with your friends anything, anywhere using Town Builders, a geospatial and augmented reality game prototype.

## Current Status

Town Builders is currently under development of its core features (rendering, multiplayer, AR & Geospatial).


First batch of gameplay features will come during summer 2023!

## About

This project aims to bring blocks to the real world through augmented reality and geospatial.

I have lots of ideas for future versions of this game, I will be working on multiplayer, gameplay, events and more.


Follow the project to get updates and do not hesitate to open issues or reach me via Discord (Sotshi#2996) if you have ideas, suggestions, anything!

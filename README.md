# Town Builders App

Place blocks to build with your friends anything, anywhere using Town Builders, a geospatial and augmented reality game prototype.


## About

This 3 weeks old project aims to bring blocks to the real world through augmented reality and geospatial.

I have lots of ideas for future versions of this game, I will be working on multiplayer, gameplay, events and more.


Follow the project to get updates and do not hesitate to open issues or reach me via Discord (Sotshi#2996) if you have ideas, suggestions, anything!
